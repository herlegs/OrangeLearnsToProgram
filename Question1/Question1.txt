Given a string, write a program to count how many finger presses is needed in order to type out the string
(Assume using standard keyboard, standard finger placement)

Eg. Given string "xiao orange"
	Left hand fourth finger type "x", right hand mid finger type "i" ......
	
expected output:
(use 1, 2, 3, 4 to represent for index finger, mid finger, fourth finger, little finger)

	left4: 2 (left little finger used 2 times)
	...
	left1: 2

	right1: ...
	...
	right4: ...

Instructions:
	implement function countFingerPresses in module solution.py

How to test:
	run "python test.py" to test your solution
